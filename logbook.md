- Abstract - Do last
- Introduction
  - Literary Review
    - Start with the broad topic of project - What are long-period, grating-based sensors? Or, what are optical fibres?
    - What has been done in the area, but needs more work - Large RI ratios between core and cladding
    - End with specific implementation - Long-period, grating-based optical fibres in extreme environments
  - Implementation - Potentially, unnecessary? Same as above child?
- Methods
  - How to reproduce this
- Results
- Discussion
  - Compare my results to the results of others - Previous student paper
- Conlusion and Evaluation

  - Conclusion
  - Evaluation
    - Remember **ERRORS** relating to rounding
