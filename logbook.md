# Dates

## 20/12/2020

### Supervisor Questions

- Harvard Referencing, or Numbered Referencing?
  - Numbered
- Previous student's paper code is horribly formatted (and in Python), might I as well start from scratch?
  - Start afresh
- Fibre or Fiber? (Do you care...)
  - British - Fibre
- Literary Review
  - How much detail should I go into w.r.t. basics of optical light transmission?
  - How much of the previous student's paper should be reviewed if we are replicating results? (I would imagine this belongs more in the discussion/evaluation)
    - Tell the story of how I got to where I am now. How original gratings are made...how they are made...now at a point of different materials...context
    - Hold hand in introduction for non-optics specialists...explain to a student collegue

### Report Progress

- Prelim report submitted

### Notes Progress

- Introduction Complete - Single-Mode and Multi-Mode

## 28/12/2020

### Report Progress

- Interim Report Started
  - Cleaned up spelling mistakes from prelim
  - Added Layout
  - Included Literary Review

### Notes Progress

- Added Chapter 1: Introduction

## 04/01/2021

### Report Progress

- Final Report
  - Added full layout

### Notes Progress

- Added Chapter 2: Fabrication
- Added Chapter 3: Transmission Characteristics

### Meeting (08/01/2021)

- Weekly/Bi-weekly updates to JS
- If stuck, ask for references
- Look into phase matching specifically for LPFGs
- Mention fabrication methods - UoG change diametre rather than $n$
- MATLAB has easier to use, included functions than vanilla bi-section method
- Compare time it takes to calculate modes from previous student paper to my use of MATLAB
  - Number of operations to find $b$
  - Built-in functions faster than vanila methods?
  - Not a Python vs MATLAB comparison!
  - Use same values previous user used
- LPG Glass fibres...then move on to Saffire fibres
- Validate whether saffire vs glass is correct for same mathematics
- Move on to cladding
  - Which mode causes $n_{eff}$ couple phases
- How much power travels through fibre
- Look into V ($\Lambda$) number

- Calculate Sellmeir
- Calculate $n_{eff}$ in Core
- Calculate $n_{eff}$ in Cladding

Assumptions

- Experiment with $\leq100T$ gratings - to validate
- How long to make the grating?
- Linear-Polerised mode ($LP$)
- Look at number of periods vs power loss

- HE modes: H - magnetic, E - electric

To evaluate paper

- How sensitive is this to parameters
- Journey of research - How can this be expanded into Saffire or HE modes

[Effective Refractive Index described in StackExchange](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/135978/effective-refractive-index-calculation-of-fiber-core)

## 18/01/2021

- **Interim Report Due**

### Supervisor Questions

- Why specific parameters? Does it relate to work being done at UoG
  - 3.1% $GeO_2$
  - Should I limit the work to $1300nm < \lambda 1600nm$, as the previous work, and why?
- Previous work pulls equations out of thin air, and I am struggling to verify them
  - Can I take them at their word?
  - Are these resources my _best-bet_ to derive the equations needed? (I have access to the book)
    - ISBN 13:978-0-12-088481-0
    - ISBN 10: 0-12-088481-X
    - University of Colerado: Modal Analysis of Step-Index Fibres
- Previous work's power modes **(TODO: improve question formulation)**

## Report Writing

- Abstract - Do last
- Introduction
  - Literary Review
    - Start with the broad topic of project - What are long-period, grating-based sensors? Or, what are optical fibres?
    - What has been done in the area, but needs more work - Large RI ratios between core and cladding
    - End with specific implementation - Long-period, grating-based optical fibres in extreme environments
  - Implementation - Potentially, unnecessary? Same as above child?
- Methods
  - How to reproduce this
- Results
- Discussion
  - Compare my results to the results of others - Previous student paper
- Conlusion and Evaluation

  - Conclusion
  - Evaluation
    - Remember **ERRORS** relating to rounding
